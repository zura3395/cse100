    <b>Demo due:</b> Tuesday February 20 end of your section.
    <p>
    <p> 
    In this lab you will again implement a state machine as part of a sequential
    circuit for the competition version of the <i>Stop It</i> game.
    <p>
    Remember that your design must be synchronous 
    with <b>the clock</b> signal specified in this lab.  This means that you must
    <ul>
    <li> use only <a href="../FDRE/FDRE.html">positive edge-triggered flip-flops</a>,
    <li> not use asynchronous clears or pre-sets of any sequential elements, 
    <li> connect only <b>the system clock</b> provided to you to the clock input pins of any sequential components,
    <li> not connect <b>the system clock</b> to any input pins other than the clock 
    input pins of sequential components, and
    <li> and only use the <b>assign</b> statement in your design.
    </ul>
    <p>
    <p>
    <H3> Overview </H3>
    <p>
    In Lab 4 you implemented the single player training version of <i>Stop It</i>.
    In Lab 5 you will implement the two player version of this game.
    In the two player version,
    a point is scored by a player if they are first to press their button when 
    the counter matches the target button,  but they lose a point if the counter did not match.
    The counter stops as soon as either player presses their button.  
    If both players press their buttons simultaneously (same clock edge) then either they 
    both score or lose a point.  Each player starts with 3 points.
    The game is over when either player reaches 6 points or 0 points.
    <p>
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li> A Go signal is given (pushbutton btnC is pressed) to start the next round.
    <li> In each round, a random 5-bit binary value, the target number, is selected and displayed on the two leftmost digits while
    the 5-bit game counter (still displayed on the rightmost digits) is held at <tt>1F</tt>.
    <li> After 2 seconds the game counter begins to decrement every quarter second.
    <li> The game counter will keep decrementing, rolling under to 1F(31 decimal), after 0.
    <li> When either or both players press their button (pushbuttons btnL and btnR)
     the game counter stops decrementing.
    <li> When the buttons are pressed the leds are adjusted as follow:
    <ol type="a">
    <li> If the target number matches the counter, then the player who pressed first
     (or both players if they pressed simultaneously), score a point.   This is indicated
    by turning on an additional led for that player (or both players).
    <li> If the target number does not match the counter, then the player who pressed first
     (or both players if they pressed simultaneously), lose a point.   This is indicated
    by turning off an led for that player (or both players).
    </ol>
    <li> If the target was matched when the counter was stopped then all four digits flash in
    unison for four seconds. Otherwise the target digits and counter digits alternate as
    they flash.
    <li> The flashing continues for four seconds and what happens next depends on whether
    the game is over. The game is over if either player has 6 leds on
    or no leds on.
    <li> When the game is not over, the leftmost digits are again blank
    and a new round can begin with a Go signal.
    <li> When the game is over, the leds of the winning player(s) flash.  A player
    will win if they have 6 leds or they have at least one led and the other player
    has none.   If both players have no leds on, then they both lost and this is
    indicated by flashing the DP segments of all four digits.
    <li> To make the target easier to match, turning on sw[14] slows the game counter so that
    it decrements every half second instead of quarter second.
    <li> To test the cases where both players press simultaneously, turning on sw[15] will
    make pressing btnL the same as pressing both btnL and btnR.
    </ol>

    (Note that sw[14], not sw[15] as mentioned in the video, slows the game counter.)

    On the Basys 3 board,
    <ul>
    <li> PushButton btnC will be used as the "Go" signal. 
    <li> PushButton btnU will be used as global reset and should only be connected
    to the module <b>qsec_clks</b> described below.
    <li> PushButtons btnL and btnR will be the buttons used by Player L and Player R.
    <li> Player R's leds will be led[5:0] with led[2:0] on at the start. 
    <li> Player L's leds will be led[15:10] with led[15:13] on at the start. 
    <li> You will be given a clock and a signal <b>qsec</b> which is <b>high for one clock cycle</b>
    roughly every 1/4 of a second. 
    The signal <b>qsec</b> should <B>NOT</B> be used as a clock.  It can be connected
    to clock enable inputs possibly with other logic to control the rate at which a counter 
    advances.
    </ul>
    <p>
    No overview this time. You probably should make your own.
    Here's some <b>Gratuitous Advice:</b> 
    <ol>
    <li>  This is an extension of Lab 4, so you probably want to start by making a copy of your
     Lab 4 project in Vivado (use the copy option under the Project menu in Vivado).
    You will need to modify the state machine and create a new LED processor.
    <li> You can make a 6 bit shifter that initializes with 3 1's and use two
    instances of it, one for each player.  (You will need to <i>manually</i> reverse the
    output of one of them.)  
    <li> Your state machine does not need to remember the score nor which player pressed
    first nor won the game. But it does need an input that tells it when the game is 
    over based on the leds.
    <li>
    Getting a state machine right usually requires 
    several iterations.  
    It is likely that in demonstrating your design the TA will discover some case 
    that is not properly handled. Often changes to the state machine are not simple.
    A complete redesign may be necessary. Trying to patch it by changing one
    signal here or there, or inserting a gate/FF, or more, almost always makes things worse.
    Please leave yourself enough time.  Hurrying will introduce more bugs that you will need
    to hunt down and squash.
    It is strongly suggested that your entire design be entered
    and simulating <b>before</b> your second section.
    </ol>
    <p>
    <H3> Instructions</H3>
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Read all of the instructions below before beginning any design.
    <p>
    <p>
    <li> Draw a state diagram for your state machine, obtain the 
    next state and output logic equations.  You'll want to use one-hot encoding.
    <p>
    <li> Enter the logic for your next state and output equations using the <b>assign</b>
    statement and
    provide flip-flops to hold the present state. 
    <br>
    Remember that the global reset will reset all flip-flops. Make sure
    this will put your state machine into its desired initial state.
    <br><b>For Lab 5, btnU will be connected to the global reset input.</b>
    <p>
    <li> Download <A href="qsec_clks.v">this verilog file</A> and save it as <b>qsec_clks.v</b> 
    <p>
    <li> In the Vivado Project Manager, add it to your project.  Make sure you select the
    option to copy it into your project.
    <p>
    <li> Add an instance of the module <b>qsec_clks</b> to your top level as follows:
    <br>
    <pre>qsec_clks slowit (.clkin(clkin), .greset(btnU), .clk(clk), .digsel(digsel), .qsec(qsec));</pre>
    The signal <b>clk</b> is your system clock.  The signal <b>digsel</b> should be
    used to advance the Ring Counter for the 7-segment displays; it should not be used as a clock!!!
    <br>The signal <b>qsec</b> is high for one clock cycle each 1/4 second (4 times per second) and  should be
    used to advance a time Counter; <b>it should not be used as a clock!!!</b>
    <p>
    <li> Simulate your entire  design.  
    <br> You will need to implement a clock in your testbench.
    The signals <b>qsec</b> and <b>digsel</b> will be high every 16<sup>th</sup> cycle of <b>clk</b> during
    simulation. They are much faster during simulation than when implemented so that
    less time must elapse during simulation.
    <br> You should simulate until the signals from your timer go high to make sure 
    your State Machine and timer are working properly together.
    <p>
    <li> Implement your design, configure the FPGA and demonstrate your design 
    to the TA.
    <p>
    <li> Once your working design has been demonstrated, follow 
    <a href="../submit.html">these directions</a> to submit your project.   
    <br>The zipped project file must be submitted no later than <b>February 26</b>.
    <p>
    <li> Remember to <a href="../archive/archive.html">archive</a> your project.
    Files left on the PC are not protected. 
    <p>
    <li>
    <b>Important</b> Please remember to turn off the power to 
    Basys 3 board when you are done. 
    </ol>
    <p>
    <p>
