    <b>Prelab due:</b> Tuesday February 6 9am PST.
    <p>

    In this lab you will implement a state machine as part of a sequential
    circuit for a game called <i>Stop It</i>.
    <p>Be sure to complete the <a href="prelab4.html">Prelab</a> so that you
    can simulate your state machine and components.
    <br>If you haven't already viewed the video in Yuja on using the simulator in Vivado ("Simulation Example")
    you will want to do that now.
    <br>It steps through simulating a multiplexor from creating the testbench to tracking
    down errors. 
    <br>When simulating your state machine you will want to add the state bus
    to your waveform viewer.
    <br>When you ask for help in the lab, the first question that will
    be asked is whether you have a simulation showing the error.
    <br>If you are having trouble running the simulator ask for help.
    
    
    <p>
    Remember that your design must be synchronous 
    with <b>the clock</b> signal specified in this lab.  This means that you must
    <ul>
    <li> use only <a href="../FDRE/FDRE.html">positive edge-triggered flip-flops</a>,
    <li> not use asynchronous clears or pre-sets of any sequential elements, 
    <li> connect only <b>the system clock</b> provided to you to the clock input pins of any sequential components,
    <li> not connect <b>the system clock</b> to any input pins other than the clock 
    input pins of sequential components, and
    <li> and only use the <b>assign</b> statement in your design.
    </ul>
    <p>
    <p>
    <H3> Overview </H3>
    <p>
    You will use the BASYS3 board to implement the following reaction/estimation single player game in
    which a 5-bit counter counting down is displayed and the player tries to stop it at a specified value.
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>At the start of each round the game counter is displayed on the rightmost two digits of the BASYS3  7-segment display.
     The left two digits are off.
    <li> A Go signal is given (pushbutton btnC is pressed) to start the next round.
    <li> In each round, a random 5-bit binary value, the target number, is selected and displayed on the two leftmost digits and
    the 5-bit game counter (still displayed on the rightmost digits) is set to <tt>1F</tt>.
    <li> After 2 seconds the game counter begins to decrement every quarter second.
    <li> The game counter will keep decrementing, rolling under to 1F(31 decimal), from 0.
    <li> When the "stop" signal is asserted (pushbutton btnU) the game counter stops decrementing.
    <li> At this point if the value of the counter matches the target number, then all 4 display digits flash for four seconds in unison.
    <li> If the value of the counter does not match the target number, then all 4 display digits flash for four seconds,
    with the target number and game counter digits alternating as they flash.
    <li> The flashing continues for four seconds and then the leftmost digits are again blank
    and a new round can begin with a Go signal.
    <li> Each time the player succeeds in matching the target, one more led lights up beginning with the rightmost.
    <li> If all 16 leds are lit, and the target number was matched, then the game has been won.
    After the digits flashes for 4 seconds, all 16 leds flash, and no button, except btnR will have an 
    effect.
    <li> To make the game easier to win (without 17 matches!), pressing btnL will be a cheat
    switch that will load the switches into the leds (or actually the shift register holding
    the values of the leds).
    </ol>

    On the BASYS3 board,
    <ul>
    <li> PushButton btnC will be used as the Go signal. 
    <li> PushButton btnU will be the "stop" signal
    <li> PushButton btnL will load the switches into the led state
    <li> PushButton btnR will be used as global reset (as usual) and should only be connected
    to the module <b>qsec_clks</b> described below.
    used to stop the game counter.
    <li> You will be given a clock <b>clk</b> and a signal <b>qsec</b> which is <b>high for one clock cycle</b>
    every 1/4 of a second. 
    The signal <b>qsec</b> should <B>NOT</B> be used as a clock.  It can be connected
    to count enable inputs possibly with other logic to control the rate at which a counter 
    advances, and to a counter to make a score flash.
    </ul>
    <p>
    <p>
    Below is the block diagram of your entire system; it has three pushbuttons and the BASYS3 clock
    (<b>clkin</b>) as inputs, and the
    outputs are for the 7-segment displays and leds.
    <br> (The BASYS3 clock <b>clkin</b> and global reset <b>btnR</b> are inputs of your top level, 
    but will not be part of your logic. They will connect only to <b>qsec_clks</b>.)

    <H3> Random Number Generator</H3>
    <p>
    You will use a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to generate a random 
    8-bit binary number.
    Below is an 8-bit linear feedback shift register. 
    This LFSR is simply an 8-bit shift 
    register where the input to the first register is the XOR of specific 
    bits in the register.
    If all the bits in the registers are 0 then the LFSR output will always be 0's.
    But otherwise it will go through a sequence of all 255 non-zero states 
    before it repeats.
    This sequence is not random, but reading the LFSR at random times 
    (assuming it cycles through enough states fast enough) 
    will give you a random 8-bit number in the same way a roulette wheel
    provides a random outcome. The choice of inputs into the XOR gate is not
    arbitrary so be sure to use the inputs exactly specified in the figure.
    <br> To avoid waiting as long as a minute for the Game Counter to reach a target number,
     we are using only 5 bits from the LFSR as the target number. But you still need
    the 8-bit linear feedback shift register.  The <tt>run</tt> input advances the LFSR
    at every clock edge.   When it is low, the LFSR will hold its value.
    <p>

    <p>
    <p>
    <H3> Game Counter</H3>
    <p>
    You will need a counter that can be reset and can count up (hmm, maybe from a recent lab ?).
    <p>
    <H3> Time Counter</H3>
    <p>
    You will need a counter that can be reset and can count up (hmm, maybe from a recent lab ?).
    <p>
    <p>
    <H3> Display</H3>
    <p>
    You will need to display the target number as well as the Game Counter and make them flash
    appropriately depending on the game state.
    You can control whether a digit of the display is on or off and make it flash
    by providing appropriate logic for its AN output.
    <p>
    <p>
    <H3> Led Display</H3>
    <p>
    The LEDs can be controlled using a 16-bit shift register with the Shift signal. Each time
    the target is matched, a 1 will be shifted in. There is also a parallel load input (LD)
    to load a 16-bit bus.   The Off signal, which forces the LED_Shifter output low, is useful
    for making the LEDs flash.
    <p>
    <p>
    <H3> State Machine</H3>
    <p>
    In the overview diagram there is a block for the state machine you must build.  
    (You may decide you want additional inputs and/or outputs.)
    Start by drawing
    a state diagram.  Make sure you cover all cases for each state.
    <p>
    Note that the inputs from the pushbuttons (btnU, btnC, and btnL) 
    <b>are not synchronized</b> with your clock (they are asynchronous).  
    You should pass these inputs through a
    syncronizer (D Flip-Flop) before using them in your circuit.
    <p>
    <b>Gratuitous Advice:</b> Getting a state machine right usually requires 
    several iterations.  
    It is likely that in demonstrating your design the TA will discover some case 
    that is not properly handled. Often changes to the state machine are not simple.
    A complete redesign may be necessary. Trying to patch it by changing one
    signal here or there, or inserting a gate/FF, or more, almost always makes things worse.
    Please leave yourself enough time.  Hurrying will introduce more bugs that you will need
    to hunt down.
    It is strongly suggested that your entire design be entered
    and simulating <b>before</b> your second section.
    <p>
    <H3> Instructions</H3>
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Read all of the instructions below before beginning any design.
    <p>
    <li>Read <a href="../fsm/fsm.html">entering a state machine</a> with Verilog.
    <p>
    <li> Make the modules for your components and if they have flip flops make sure they
    initialize to the appropriate values. For example, your LFSR should <b>not</b> start
    with the contents 00000000 when the global reset is asserted (not GO).  Since the
    global reset (which we will connect to btnR below) resets all flip-flops to 0 you will
    need to arrange for at least one of the bits to be 1 on the global reset.
    <p>
    <li> Draw a state diagram for your state machine, obtain the 
    next state and output logic equations.  You'll want to use one-hot encoding.
    <p>
    <li> Enter the logic for your next state and output equations using the <b>assign</b>
    statement and
    provide flip-flops to hold the present state. 
    <br>
    Remember that the global reset will reset all flip-flops. Make sure
    this will put your state machine into its desired initial state.
    <p>
    <li> Simulate your state machine.  It is much easier to catch problems when you 
    control the FourSecs and TwoSecs signals rather than waiting many clock cycles for 
    it in the simulation of the whole design.
    <p>
    <li>In your top level, connect your state machine, LFSR, counters, 16-bit LED shifter,
    the inputs and outputs, and anything else you need.  
    Create a net named <b>clk</b>, connect it to the clock input of your 
    state machine, LFSR, counters and any other sequential components. 
    This is the <b>system clock</b> for the design.  It is the only signal
    which can be used as a clock in your design and it should not be connected
    to anything other than a clock input.
    <p>
    <li> Download <A href="qsec_clks.v">this verilog file</A> and save it as <b>qsec_clks.v</b> 
    in your project directory.
    <p>
    <li> In the Vivado Project Manager, add it to your project.  Make sure you select the
    option to copy it into your project.
    <p>
    <li> Add an instance of the module <b>qsec_clks</b> to your top level as follows:
    <br>
    <pre>qsec_clks slowit (.clkin(clkin), .greset(btnR), .clk(clk), .digsel(digsel), .qsec(qsec));</pre>
    The signal <b>clk</b> is your system clock.  The signal <b>digsel</b> should be
    used to advance the Ring Counter for the 7-segment displays; it should not be used as a clock!!!
    <br>The signal <b>qsec</b> is high for one clock cycle each 1/4 second (4 times per second) and  should be
    used to advance the Time Counter; <b>it should not be used as a clock!!!</b>
    <p>
    <li> Simulate your entire  design.  
    <br> You will need to implement a clock in your test fixture.
    The signals <b>qsec</b> and <b>digsel</b> will be high every 16<sup>th</sup> cycle of <b>clk</b> during
    simulation. They are much faster during simulation than when implemented so that
    less time must elapse during simulation.
    <br> You should simulate until the signals from your timer go high to make sure 
    your State Machine and the Time counter are working properly together.
    <p>
    <li> Implement your design, configure the FPGA and demonstrate your design 
    to the TA.
    <p>
    <li> Once your working design has been demonstrated, follow 
    <a href="../submit.html">these directions</a> to submit your project.   
    The zipped project file must be submitted by the due date of the write-up.
    <br>(You can continue to improve your project for the write-up if desired,
    but you should submit the version you demonstrated.) 
    <p>
    <li> Remember to <a href="../archive/archive.html">archive</a> your project.
    Files left on the PC are not protected. 
    <p>
    <li>
    <b>Important</b> Please remember to turn off the power to 
    BASYS3 board when you are done. 
    </ol>
